# labwc-artwork

This repository is for [`labwc`](https://github.com/labwc/labwc) wayland
compositor users and developers to add icons, wallpapers, themes or
other general artwork.

Image format is not important, but in the spirit of the `labwc` project,
all additions should be light weight.

Icons are not a part of the [labwc roadmap](https://github.com/johanmalm/labwc/wiki/Acceptance-criteria)
to be included in the main project however they can be shared here for
window button theming, inclusion in wallpapers, fonts or whatever.

The `utils` directory contains programs and scripts for reproducing
images to do with `labwc`.
